# Document-Vectorization-with-Python-NLP-Techniques-and-Analysis
This project implements document vectorization using Python and NLP techniques. It applies text normalization methods (lemmatization, stemming, POS-tagging) and explores vectorization strategies like One Hot Encoding, TF, and TF-IDF. The analysis compares results and highlights the impact of preprocessing on document representation.
